# SQL Data Cleaning Project

## Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, standardizing, and preparing a real-world tech layoffs dataset sourced from Kaggle: “Layoffs Dataset: Tech layoffs from COVID-19 (2019) to present.”

The dataset captures layoffs across global technology companies during one of the most volatile periods in modern economic history. The primary goal of this project was to transform raw, messy data into high-quality, analysis-ready data using SQL-based data cleaning techniques.
